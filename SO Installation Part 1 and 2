SO Installation Part 1:
- start with the securityonion.net website for installation
- from the website, go to Software and then download
  - this will take you to a Github that will allow you to download the ISO
  - check the hash and signature of the download to make sure nothing was corrupted in transit
    - certutil -hashfile .\(securityonion) SHA256  /// powershell
    - within the github, it provides a SHA256 hash that you can use to compare to the one that you generated to
        make sure nothing ended up corrupting
  - download the security key from the security onion website using wget (command found at 1:41 in the video)
    - need to install gpg to import

  - this account is used to use the command line on the Security Onion server / this is not the same as accounts used on the log into the security onion web console
- press enter when finishing (if needed) to finish up the rest of the configuration
  -  reboot the VM afterwards (see where ^^ takes you first though / a console with 

SO Installation Part 2:

  - select standard unless needed otherwise
