SO Installation Part 1:
- Start with the securityonion.net website for installation
- From the website, go to Software and then download
  - This will take you to a Github that will allow you to download the ISO
  - Check the hash and signature of the download to make sure nothing was corrupted in transit
    - certutil -hashfile .\(securityonion) SHA256  /// powershell
    - Within the github, it provides a SHA256 hash that you can use to compare to the one that you generated to
        make sure nothing ended up corrupting
  - Download the security key from the security onion website using wget (command found at 1:41 in the video)
    - Need to install gpg to import
    - Compare the signature with what is provided within the github
      - There is step by step with syntax on the website 
  - At the end of the github, it takes you to the security onion website where there is an installion guide
    - Everything previous was leading up to the actual installation, was verifying that everything is setup correctly
- When accessing the VM, make sure the ISO is selected 
  - Make sure to customize hardware requirements to fit the needs of ssecurity onion
- After the VM is created, boot it and when prompted to select an option, leave it as Security Onion (2.4.10) or just the first option
- You are going to be prompted with a screen that asks "Do you wish to continue?"
  - The "downside" to this is that it is going to clear the partitions, but since it is a brand new VM, this is fine 
- You will then be asked to create a administrative username
  - This account is used to use the command line on the Security Onion server / this is not the same as accounts used on the log into the security onion web console
- Press enter when finishing (if needed) to finish up the rest of the configuration
  -  Reboot the VM afterwards (see where ^^ takes you first though / a console prompt)

SO Installation Part 2: 
* In Part 1, the main purpose of it was to get the Security Onion ISO onto a VM, make sure the image is on the VM correctly and create your administrative account

- Reopen the VM (if not open already) and login to the administrative account created during installation
- After pressing space to progress through the menus, you will be prompted to install standard Security Onion or configure network 
  - Select standard unless needed otherwise
