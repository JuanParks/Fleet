# ELK Queries
## Special Characters
There are special characters that exist within the ELK Query Language that are reserved for specific use. If instance, using a + within a query will cause the query to error. However, if you 'escape' the character
  using a backslash [\\], then it will be able to be used within the query

## Wildcards
Wildcards allow for general searches to be done. The wildcard character [*] is used
