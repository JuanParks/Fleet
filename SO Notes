Security Onion Fundamentals / Setting it up
Notes from Introduction: 
- A high level visiability tool that is used for security
- Runs different applications from Elastic, such as ElasticStack (for data storage), LogStash for ingesting logs, Elastic Fleet/Agent for deploying different agents and log ingesting as well
- In terms of network and host data, there are applications that generate such 
    * Elastic Agent - combined all of the ElasticBeats, such as WinLogBeats, FIleBeats,etc. <-- these are to be deployed on the endpoint(s) to ingest Windows event logs or syslog data, 
    * OSquery - open source, allows us to query our system as if it is a relational satabase / meaning you can see the users on a box and this can be queryed / this applys to all of the endpoints that 
        OSquery is on and displays the information
    * Steno - this is primarily for pcaps
    * Suricata - generates alerts from network data (can also generate metadata about network traffic)
    * Zeek - also generates metadata about network traffic
    * Strelka - used for file analysis (make sure you know how to extract files from network data)
- Analyst Tools (within the SO "console" / the website interface)
    * Alerts
    * Hunt
    * Dashboard
    * Cases
    * CyberChef - integrated tool (swiss army knife in data analysis / base64 decode)
    * Playbook - integrates Sigma to create and enable detection built around Sigma rules
    * ElasticFleet - manage our ElasticAgents as well as run live queries using OSquery
    * Attack Navigator - visualize our attack coverage for all of the dectections through playbook
    * Kibana - another window into our data using our Elastic tools

    * Look for a standalone deployment mode - meaning these previous tools are all ran together / this is what we used previously
