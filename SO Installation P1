  - this will take you to a Github that will allow you to download the ISO
  - check the hash and signature of the download to make sure nothing was corrupted in transit
    - certutil -hashfile .\(securityonion) SHA256  /// powershell
    - within the github, it provides a SHA256 hash that you can use to compare to the one that you generated to
        make sure nothing ended up corrupting
  - download the security key from the security onion website using wget (command found at 1:41 in the video)
    - need to install gpg to import
    - compare the signature with what is provided within the github
      - there is step by step with syntax on the website 
  - at the end of the github, it takes you to the security onion website where there is an installion guide
    - everything previous was leading up to the actual installation, was verifying that everything is setup correctly
